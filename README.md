## üö¶ How to Use

### 1. **Run the Python Script**
- Requires [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install required packages:
pip install pygame pillow playsound

- Run in terminal:
python Nathans_Toggler.py

### 2. **(Optional) Build Your Own EXE**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why is the EXE so big?
- Python `.exe` files made with PyInstaller or similar tools **bundle the entire Python interpreter and all dependencies**. This is normal and can easily result in files **50‚Äì100+ MB**.
- The size is not a sign of malware or bloat‚Äîjust how Python packaging works.

#### üí° Reducing EXE Size
- Try the `--onefile` flag with PyInstaller:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon3.ico Nathans_Toggler.py

- For advanced users, tools like **UPX** can compress executables, but savings are often modest.
- Remove unused imports or features to trim further.
- If a small file is crucial, distribute the `.py` script and required assets instead.

### 3. **(Optional) Batch & PowerShell Launchers**
- Included `.bat` and `.ps1` files help with admin elevation and easy launching if preferred.
